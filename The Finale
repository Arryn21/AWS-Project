Check Load balancer is having the image
go to mysql server and drop the table > come to browser and refresh SamplePage.php that table will generate automatically
in autoscaling try changing desired value to 3
then on running instances 2 machines will start automatically

So the machines that are generated by auto scaling wont be directly accessible coz it wont have public IP
To access them
Copy DNS name from load balancer
and make its Entry under CNAME <DNS name> in Route 53

Confirm Health Checks

DONE!!

Stop / Delete / Terminate each and all services which are gonna cost you
