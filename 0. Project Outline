We need to host a website. and store data in database.
VPC > private and public subnet.
EC2 machine ; autoscaling ; loadbalancer ;  RDS
public      ;   private   ;    public    ;  private




We have AWS Cloud where we can host Virtual machines and lots of other things.

First we set up a VPC - Virtual Private Cloud
    think of it as a big private container inside a larger public container.
    this private container's access is defined by us, whether we want to keep it public or private or both

Then we setup IP addresses (subnets) through which we will access that VPC by our local machines.
    We have our big private container at some facility of AWS. now we need to access it.
    so we setup subnets.

We give internet gateway to this subnet that is connect the subnet to the outer world of internet

Now we configure Paths. i.e Route Table with the subnet that is ofcourse inside our VPC
